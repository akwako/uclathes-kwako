In this paper, we expand the discussion beyond bias as a function of the individual national origin of the speaker to look for bias as a function of the geopolitical orientation of their nation of origin. We audit some of the most popular English language ASR services using a large and global data set of speech from The Speech Accent Archive, which includes over 2,700 speakers of English born in 171 different countries. We show that, even when controlling for multiple linguistic covariates, ASR service performance has a statistically significant relationship to the political alignment of the speaker's birth country with respect to the United States' geopolitical power. This holds for all ASR services tested. We discuss this bias in the context of the historical use of language to maintain global and political power.},

Today, automated speaker recognition is deployed on billions of smart devices and in services such as call centres. Despite their wide-scale deployment and known sources of bias in related domains like face recognition and natural language processing, bias in automated speaker recognition has not been studied systematically. We present an in-depth empirical and analytical study of bias in the machine learning development workflow of speaker verification, a voice biometric and core task in automated speaker recognition. Drawing on an established framework for understanding sources of harm in machine learning, we show that bias exists at every development stage in the well-known VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge, including data generation, model building, and implementation. Most affected are female speakers and non-US nationalities, who experience significant performance degradation. Leveraging the insights from our findings, we make practical recommendations for mitigating bias in automated speaker recognition, and outline future research directions.

In addition, we manually annotated 150 utterances per speaker to identify three types of mispronunciation errors: substitutions, deletions, and additions, making it a valuable resource not only for research in voice conversion and accent conversion but also in computer-assisted pronunciation training.

Like other machine learning technologies, speech and language technologies (re)produce structural oppression when they perform worse for marginalised language communities. Using knowledge and theories from sociolinguistics, I explore why commercial automatic speech recognition systems and other language technologies perform significantly worse for already marginalised populations, such as second-language speakers and speakers of stigmatised varieties of English in the British Isles. Situating language technologies within the broader scholarship around algorithmic bias, consider the allocative and representational harms they can cause even (and perhaps especially) in systems which do not exhibit predictive bias, narrowly defined as differential performance between groups. This raises the question whether addressing or "fixing" this "bias" is actually always equivalent to mitigating the harms algorithmic systems can cause, in particular to marginalised communities.

Yet, few works investigated the impact on performance when the data properties substantially differ between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases, termed domain shift. We target this scenario by analyzing the robustness of Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R models on downstream ASR for a completely unseen domain, air traffic control (ATC) communications. We benchmark these two models on several open-source and challenging ATC databases with signal-to-noise ratio between 5 to 20 dB. Relative word error rate (WER) reductions between 20% to 40% are obtained in comparison to hybrid-based ASR baselines by only fine-tuning E2E acoustic models with a smaller fraction of labeled data. We analyze WERs on the low-resource scenario and gender bias carried by one ATC dataset.},
